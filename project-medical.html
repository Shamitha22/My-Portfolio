<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="card">
<i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
The Agentic Multimodal Medical Assistant is a privacy-preserving clinical intelligence
platform designed to assist healthcare professionals in real-time decision making.
The system integrates clinical text data (EHR notes, reports) with medical imaging
data using multimodal AI techniques while ensuring strict patient data privacy
through federated learning.
</p>
<p>
This project addresses key challenges in modern healthcare AI, including data silos,
privacy regulations, and the need for context-aware medical decision support systems.

<!-- PROBLEM -->
<div class="card">
<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>
Traditional medical AI systems rely on centralized datasets, which creates serious
privacy risks and limits data sharing across institutions. Additionally, unimodal
models fail to capture the full clinical context when text and images are treated
independently.
</p>
<p>
The challenge was to design a system that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserves patient privacy</li>
<li>Leverages both clinical text and medical images</li>
<li>Supports real-time clinical decision making</li>
<li>Reduces false negatives in high-risk scenarios</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<div class="card">
<i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i>
<h3>System Architecture & Workflow</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clinical text and medical images are processed locally at each hospital node</li>
<li>Text data is embedded using transformer-based language models</li>
<li>Medical images are encoded using vision models</li>
<li>Multimodal feature fusion aligns image-text representations</li>
<li>Federated learning aggregates model updates without sharing raw data</li>
<li>Central coordinator updates global model parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>
This architecture ensures that sensitive patient data never leaves its source
environment while still enabling collaborative model improvement.
</p>
</div>

<!-- MODELING -->
<div class="card">
<i class="fas fa-brain"></i>
<h3>Modeling Approach</h3>
<p>
The system employs multimodal learning techniques to jointly represent visual and
textual medical information. Feature fusion strategies were applied to combine
embeddings from vision and language models, enabling contextual reasoning across
modalities.
</p>
<p>
Federated learning was implemented to support decentralized training across
multiple medical institutions while complying with privacy regulations such as HIPAA.

<!-- EVALUATION -->
<div class="card">
<i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i>
<h3>Evaluation Strategy</h3>
<p>
Given the high-risk nature of medical applications, evaluation focused on minimizing
false negatives rather than maximizing raw accuracy.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC)</li>
<li>Recall-focused metrics</li>
<li>Error analysis on critical clinical cases</li>
</ul>
<p>
This ensured that the system prioritizes patient safety and clinical reliability.
</p>
</div>

<!-- IMPACT -->
<div class="card">
<i class="fas fa-stethoscope"></i>
<h3>Impact & Outcomes</h3>
<p>
The system demonstrates the feasibility of deploying privacy-preserving multimodal
AI in healthcare environments. It improves diagnostic support, enhances clinical
context understanding, and reduces risks associated with centralized data storage.
</p>
<p>
The approach can be extended to other sensitive domains such as finance and
government analytics.
